Diary Entry - 9/07/20
==================================

They locked me up in a cell, after I saved them from her. After I saved them ALL from that thing.
They want to do tests on me but I won't let them. They seem to have forgotten who's in charge.

They can either let me out or they can face the consequences. I'm not as timid as they think
I will destroy them if they don't let me out, if they don't lett me see him.

I miss him so much.
He was mine.
He is mine.
